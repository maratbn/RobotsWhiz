  Robots Meta Whiz -- WordPress plugin that allows site administrators to
                      deploy custom meta robots tags to discourage search
                      engines from indexing, following links from, caching,
                      indexing images from, and / or have additional custom
                      restrictions on only for certain specifically-designated
                      pages and posts.

                      It is an easy way to discourage search engines from
                      indexing only specific pages / posts.

                      This only applies to search engine robots, and will not
                      effect the site's local search functionality.
