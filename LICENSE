  RobotsWhiz -- WordPress plugin that allows site administrators to discourage
                search engines from indexing, following links from, caching,
                indexing images from, and / or have additional custom
                restrictions on only for certain specifically-designated pages
                and posts.

                It is an easy way to discourage search engines from indexing
                only specific pages / posts.

                This only applies to search engine robots, and will not effect
                the site's local search functionality.
