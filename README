Version: 1.2.0-development_unreleased

The latest release is in the git branch 'master--release--1.0'.

Overview:

  At the time of this writing, the latest version of WordPress, version 4.6.1,
  has functionality to discourage search engines from indexing the whole site,
  but not functionality to discourage search engines from indexing only certain
  specific pages and posts of the site.

  Robots Meta Whiz is a WordPress plugin that allows site administrators to
  deploy custom meta robots tags to discourage search engines from indexing,
  following links from, caching, indexing images from, and / or have
  additional custom restrictions on only for certain specifically-designated
  pages and posts.

  It is an easy way to discourage search engines from indexing only specific
  pages / posts.

  This only applies to search engine robots, and will not effect the site's
  local search functionality.

Technical summary:

  Plugin works by hooking-in special logic into the action 'wp_head' to inject
  the tag <meta name='robots' content='...'> with restriction directives for
  the specified pages and posts.
